### Background

### Requirements

The following are the minimum requirements. Treat this project as if it's your own project and refactor where you see fit.

- As a visitor, when I visit `/` path, I'm presented with a Lead collection form.
- When I enter my details and hit submit, my details are saved, and I'm given a thank you message.
- As an admin, when I visit `/admin` path, I'm presented with a login page
- When I enter my username and password, it takes me to `/leads` page which displays a list of leads we have in the database.
- When calling `/leads` API on the server side, you need to add a basic authentication header using the username and password from the login page.
- Visiting `/leads` path directly will result in an error (API returns error) if a user is not logged in and the user needs to be aware of such.
- You'll need to update the server side so that the `/leads` path is protected using a basic authenticated with `user` as username and `password` as password. Please do this so that we can make more pages private in the future.
